<h2>Warning to the Public</h2>

<h2>CONCERNING</h2>

<h2>THE LOVING BALLAD OF LORD BATEMAN.</h2>


<p>In some collection of old English Ballads there is an ancient ditty which I
am told bears some remote and distant resemblance to the following Epic
Poem. I beg to quote the emphatic language of my estimable friend (if he
will allow me to call him so), the Black Bear in Piccadilly, and to assure
all to whom these presents may come, that &quot;<i>I</i> am the original.&quot; This
affecting legend is given in the following pages precisely as I have
frequently heard it sung on Saturday nights, outside a house of general
refreshment (familiarly termed a wine vaults) at Battle-bridge. The singer
is a young gentleman who can scarcely have numbered nineteen summers, and
who before his last visit to the treadmill, where he was erroneously
incarcerated for six months as a vagrant (being unfortunately mistaken for
another gentleman), had a very melodious and plaintive tone of voice,
which, though it is now somewhat impaired by gruel and such a getting up
stairs for so long a period, I hope shortly to find restored. I have taken
down the words from his own mouth at different periods, and have been
careful to preserve his pronunciation, together with the air to which he
does so much justice. Of his execution of it, however, and the intense
melancholy which he communicates to such passages of the song as are most
susceptible of such an expression, I am unfortunately unable to convey to
the reader an adequate idea, though I may hint that the effect seems to me
to be in part produced by the long and mournful drawl on the last two or
three words of each verse.</p>

<p>I had intended to have dedicated my imperfect illustrations of this
beautiful Romance to the young gentleman in question. As I cannot find,
however, that he is known among his friends by any other name than &quot;The
Tripe-skewer,&quot; which I cannot but consider as a <i>soubriquet</i>, or
nick-name; and as I feel that it would be neither respectful nor proper to
address him publicly by that title, I have been compelled to forego the
pleasure. If this should meet his eye, will he pardon my humble attempt to
embellish with the pencil the sweet ideas to which he gives such feeling
utterance? And will he believe me to remain his devoted admirer,</p>

<p class="right">GEORGE CRUIKSHANK?</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The above is not my writing, nor the notes either, nor am I on
familiar terms (but quite the contrary) with the Black Bear. Nevertheless I
admit the accuracy of the statement relative to the public singer whose
name is unknown, and concur generally in the sentiments above expressed
relative to him.</p>

<span><i>Some foreign country for to see.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<br />
The reader is here in six words artfully made acquainted with Lord
Bateman's character and temperament.&mdash;Of a roving, wandering, and unsettled
spirit, his Lordship left his native country, bound he knew not whither.
<i>Some</i> foreign country he wished to see, and that was the extent of his
desire; any foreign country would answer his purpose&mdash;all foreign countries
were alike to him. He was a citizen of the world, and upon the world of
waters, sustained by the daring and reckless impulses of his heart, he
boldly launched. For anything, from pitch-and-toss upwards to manslaughter,
his Lordship was prepared. Lord Bateman's character at this time, and his
expedition, would appear to Have borne a striking resemblance to those of
Lord Byron.
<br />
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>His goblets brimmed with every costly wine,<br /></span>
<span>And all that mote to luxury invite.<br /></span>
<span>Without a sigh he left to cross the brine,<br /></span>
<span>And traverse Paynim shores, and pass earth's central line.<br /></span>

<span><i>This Turk he had, &amp;c.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<br />
The poet has here, by that bold license which only genius can venture upon,
surmounted the extreme difficulty of introducing any particular Turk, by
assuming a fore-gone conclusion in the reader's mind, and adverting in a
casual, careless way to a Turk unknown, as to an old acquaintance. &quot;<i>This</i>
Turk he had&mdash;&quot; We have heard of no Turk before, and yet this familiar
introduction satisfies us at once that we know him well. He was a pirate,
no doubt, of a cruel and savage disposition, entertaining a hatred of the
Christian race, and accustomed to garnish his trees and vines with such
stray professors of Christianity as happened to fall into his hands. &quot;This
Turk he had&mdash;&quot; is a master-stroke&mdash;a truly Shakspearian touch. There are
few things like it in the language.</div>

artlessness, and holiest affections of woman's gentle nature. Bred up among
the rough and savage crowds which thronged her father's lawless halls, and
meeting with no responsive or kindred spirit among those fierce barbarians
(many of whom, however, touched by her surpassing charms, though insensible
to her virtues and mental endowments, had vainly sought her hand in
marriage), this young creature had spent the greater part of her life in
the solitude of her own apartments, or in contemplating the charms of
nature arrayed in all the luxury of eastern voluptuousness. At length she
hears from an aged and garrulous attendant, her only female adviser (for
her mother died when she was yet an infant), of the sorrows and sufferings
of the Christian captive. Urged by pity and womanly sympathy, she repairs
to his prison to succour and console him. She supports his feeble and
tottering steps to her father's cellar, recruits his exhausted frame with
copious draughts of sparkling wine, and when his dim eye brightens, and his
pale cheek becomes flushed with the glow of returning health and animation,
she&mdash;unaccustomed to disguise or concealment, and being by nature all
openness and truth&mdash;gives vent to the feelings which now thrill her maiden
heart for the first time, in the rich gush of unspeakable love, tenderness,
and devotion&mdash;

<span><i>I'll make a wow, and I'll keep it strong</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<br />Love has converted the tender girl into a majestic heroine; she cannot only
make &quot;a wow,&quot; but she can &quot;keep it strong;&quot; she feels all the dignity of
truth and love swelling in her bosom. With the view of possessing herself
of the real state of Lord Bateman's affections, and with no sordid or
mercenary motives, she has enquired of that nobleman what are his means of
subsistence, and whether <i>all</i> Northumberland belongs to him. His Lordship
has rejoined, with a noble regard for truth, that <i>half</i> Northumberland is
his, and that he will give it freely to the fair young lady who will
release him from his dungeon. She, being thus assured of his regard and
esteem, rejects all idea of pecuniary reward, and offers to be a party to a
solemn wow&mdash;to be kept strong on both sides&mdash;that, if for seven years he
will remain a bachelor, she, for the like period, will remain a maid. The
contract is made, and the lovers are solemnly contracted.</div>

In this may be recognised, though in a minor degree, the same gifted hand
that portrayed the Mussulman, the pirate, the father, and the bigot, in two
words. The time is gone, the historian knows it, and that is enough for the
reader. This is the dignity of history very strikingly exemplified.</div>

<span><i>Avay and avay and avay vent he.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<br />
Nothing perhaps could be more ingeniously contrived to express the vastness
of Lord Bateman's family mansion than this remarkable passage. The proud
young porter had to thread courts, corridors, galleries, and staircases
innumerable, before he could penetrate to those exquisite apartments in
which Lord Bateman was wont to solace his leisure hours, with the most
refined pleasures of his time. We behold him hastening to the presence of
his lord: the repetition of the word &quot;avay&quot; causes us to feel the speed
with which he hastens&mdash;at length he arrives. Does he appear before the
chief with indecent haste? Is he described as rushing madly into his
presence to impart his message? No! a different atmosphere surrounds that
remarkable man. Even this proud young porter is checked in his impetuous
career which lasted only

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span><i>Until</i> he came to Lord Bateman's chamber,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span><i>Vot news! vot news! my proud young porter?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<br />
A pleasant condescension on the part of his lordship, showing that he
recognised the stately youth, and no less stately pride of office which
characterized his follower, and that he was acquainted with the
distinguishing appellation which he appears to have borne in the family.</div>

<span><i>And broke his sword in splinters three.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<br />
Exemplifying, in a highly poetical and striking manner, the force of Lord
Bateman's love, which he would seem to have kept strong as his &quot;wow.&quot; We
have beheld him patient in confinement, descending to no base murmurings
against fortune, even when chained by the middle to a tree, with the
prospect of ending his days in that ignominious and unpleasant position. He
has borne all this and a great deal more, seven years and a fortnight have
elapsed, and, at last, on the mere mention of the fair young lady, he falls
into a perfect phrenzy, and breaks his sword, the faithful partner and
companion of his glory, into three splinters. Antiquarians differ
respecting the intent and meaning of this ceremony, which has been
construed and interpreted in many different ways. The strong probability is
that it was done &quot;for luck;&quot; and yet Lord Bateman should have been superior
to the prejudices of the vulgar.</div>

So called doubtless from the mosque of St. Sophia, at Constantinople; her

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span><i>Then up and spoke this young bride's mother,</i><br /></span>
<span><i>Who never vos heerd to speak so free.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<br />
This is an exquisite touch of nature, which most married men, whether of
noble or plebeian blood, will quickly recognise. During the whole of her
daughter's courtship, the good old lady had scarcely spoken, save by
expressive smiles and looks of approval. But now that her object is gained,
and her daughter fast married (as she thinks), she suddenly assumes quite a
new tone, &quot;and never was heerd to speak so free.&quot; It would be difficult for
poetry to comprehend any thing more strictly true and life-like than this.</div>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span><i>With both their hearts so full of glee.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<br />
If any thing could add to the grace and beauty of the poem, it would be
this most satisfactory and agreeable conclusion. At the time of the foreign
lady's arrival on the shores of England, we find Lord Bateman in the
disagreeable dilemma of having contracted another marriage; to which step
his lordship has doubtless been impelled by despair of ever recovering his
lost Sophia, and a natural anxiety not to die without leaving an heir to
his estate. The ceremony has been performed, the Church has done its
office, the bride and her mamma have taken possession of the castle, when
the lost Sophia suddenly presents herself. An ordinary man would have been
overwhelmed by such a complication of perplexities&mdash;not so Lord Bateman.
Master of the human heart, he appeals to feminine ambition and love of
display; and, reminding the young lady that she came to him on a saddle
horse (with her revered parent following no doubt on foot behind), offers
to bestow upon her a coach and three. The young lady closes with the
proposition; her august mother, having brought it about by her freedom of
speech, makes no objection; Lord Bateman, being a nobleman of great power,
and having plenty of superfluous wealth to bestow upon the Church, orders
another marriage, and boldly declares the first one to be a nullity.
Thereupon &quot;another marriage&quot; is immediately prepared, and the piece closes
with a picture of general happiness and hilarity.</div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
